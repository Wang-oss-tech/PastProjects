 * RISC-V 32-bit Instruction Level Simulator
 *
 * ECE 18-447
 * Carnegie Mellon University
 *
 * This file contains the interface to the memory backend for the simulator. The
 * backend handles abstracting the processor memory from the core simulator
 * functions.
 *
 * Specifically, this file contains the interface that is only used by the core
 * simulator, and definitions required to define the CPU state. The RISC-V
 * simulator uses a segmented memory model, dividing memory into 5 separate
 * segments. There are segments for the user data and text, kernel data and
 * text, and a stack segment that is shared between the user and kernel space.
